Indeed, Bacon is a man of versatile genius. He has written a varied type of prose which is philosophical. He is a master of Latin. The larger part of his works is in this language. In literature, he is famous mainly, for his 'Advancement of Learning' (1605), 'Essays' (published in a final form in 1625) and 'New Atlantis' (1626). The 'Essays' patterned after French essayist Montaigne's 'Essais' mark the beginning of one of the most popular forms of literature in the English. language. Scores of sentences from them have become proverbs:

     <h2>Of Studies</h2>
          
      <div>
        <p><span> 
Studies serve for Delight, for Ornament, and for Ability. Their Chief Use for Delight, is in Privateness and Retiring; For Ornament, is in Discourse; And for ability, is in the Judgement and Disposition of Business. For Expert Men can Execute, and perhaps Judge of particulars, one by one; But the general Counsels, and the Plots, and Marshalling of Affairs, come best from those that are Learned. To spend too much Time in Studies, is Sloth; To use them too much for Ornament, is Affectation; To make Judgement wholly by their Rules is the Humour of a Scholar. They perfect Nature, and are perfected by Experience: For Natural Abilities, are like Natural Plants, that need Proyning by Study: And Studies themselves, do give forth Directions too much at large, except they be bounded in by experience. Crafty Men Contemn Studies; Simple Men Admire them; And Wise Men Use them: For they teach not their own use; But that is a Wisdom without them, and above them, won by Observation. Read not to Contradict, and Confute; Nor to Believe and Take for granted; Nor to Find Talk and Discourse, But to weigh and Consider. Some Bookes are to be Tasted, Others to be Swallowed, and some Few to be Chewed and Digested: That is, some Bookes are to be read only in Parts; Others to be read but not Curiously; And some Few to be read wholly, and with Diligence and Attention. Some Bookes also may be read by Deputy, and Extracts made of them by Others: But that would be, only in the less important Arguments, and the Meaner Sort of Bookes; else distilled Bookes, are like Common distilled Waters, Flashy Things, Reading maketh a Full Man; Conference a Ready Man; And Writing an Exact Man. And therefore, If a Man Write little, he had need have a Great memory; If he Confer little, he had need have a Present Wit; And if he Read little, he had need have much Cunning, to seem to know that, he doth not. Histories make Men Wise; Poets Witty, The Mathematics Subtile, Natural Philosophy deep; Moral Grave; Logick and Rhetorick able to Contend. Abeunt Studia in Mores. Nay there is no Stond or Impediment in the Wit, but may be wrought out by Fit Studies: Like as Diseases of the Body, may have Appropriate Exercises. Bowling is good for the Stone and Reines; Shooting for the Lungs and Breast; Gentle Walking for the Stomach; Riding for the Head; and the like. So if a Man's Wit be Wandering, let him Study the Mathematics; For in Demonstrations, if his Wit be called away never so little, he must begin again: if his Wit be not Apt to distinguish or find differences, let him Study the Schoole-men; For they are Cymini sectares. If he be not Apt to beat over Matters, and to call up one Thing, to Prove and Illustrate another, let him Study the Lawyer's Cases: So every Defect of the Mind, may have a Special Receipt.

    <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <p><span>
Summary of the essay in English: Studies are a source of delight in one's leisure and seclusion. They also have an ornamental value: one can embellish one's conversation with-studies also help to develop one's ability to judge and handle one's affairs with ease and success Learned and experienced men have better ability to judge persons or situations. A learned man can also be expected to formulate general plans and policies. At the same time, Bacon asserts that it is a sign of indolence to spend too much time on studies. To use too much of what one studies in one's conversation to embellish one's speech is a sign of false show of knowledge or vain display of learning. Studies and practical experience are, complementary to each other. A balanced combination of learning and experience perfect a man's personality. Bythemselves they are imperfect. One's talents are moulded into proper shape by studies, and studies which give clear and systematic guidance are put to specific use by experience Cunning men look down upon studies as useless. They consider that their cunningness will prove better than experience, Simple men are awed and look with wonder at studies. It is only wise men who use studies in their day to-day life

 A book should not be read merely in order to oppose and to pre re wrong what is said in it, 1.c.. one should not approach a book with the idea of criticising and contradicting its arguments. Neither one should find the opportunity of discussion but carefully take all aspects in order to understand and form a sound opinion about the matter. Nor should one accept as such whatever is written in the books but one should weigh it at the scale of one's wisdom. One should read a book, so that, one can think carefully over what it says and then judge its value.

Some books are to be read in parts only. Others are to be read through. hastily Only a few are to be read carefully and assimilated. In case of some books. one can summarise the whole book. But this method should be adopted only in the case of books which are not of great importance, as one cannot get pleasure out of the summaries of good books.

Reading fills the mind with new ideas and thoughts and develops the whole personality of a man. Conversation makes a man alert and quick-witted, never at a loss for words. Through by taking down notes of what he reads, a man becomes systematic and precise in his talking and thinking. Studies help a man to mould his personality. Different kinds of books have different kinds of effect on the reader. History makes a man wise. Poetry develops man's imagination and ingenuity. Mathematics makes a man's mind subtle and sharp. Logic and rhetoric develops a man's ability to debate and argue. Philosophy enables a man to go deep into a subject. Man's mental deficiencies can be cured by the study of suitable subjects just as the deficiencies of the body can be cured by physical exercise. Bowling is good for the kidneys; shooting is good for the lungs and walking is good for the digestion. Similarly, the study of mathematics is good for wandering minds. If a man suffers from a confusion of thought he should take up the study of philosophy. Thus, every mental deficiency can be cured by studies,
